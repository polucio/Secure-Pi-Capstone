# Secure-Pi: An Advanced AI-Powered Cybersecurity Testbed

## Project Overview
This project is a self-contained, high-performance cybersecurity testbed built on a Raspberry Pi 5. Its primary goal is to demonstrate the practical application of AI in network security by detecting and analyzing simulated attacks. The system is designed to be a portfolio piece for a WGU capstone and a presentation to the CCD AI committee, showcasing skills in hardware integration, system administration, and machine learning.

The project uses a multi-device setup to simulate a real-world attack-and-defense scenario, with a centralized AI-powered defender, a dedicated honeypot, and a mobile attacker.

## Key Features
- **AI-Powered Threat Detection:** Leverages a Hailo-8L AI Accelerator to perform real-time analysis of network traffic and identify malicious behavior.  
- **High-Speed & Secure System:** Runs the operating system and applications from a fast NVMe SSD for superior performance and reliability.  
- **Controlled Lab Environment:** Uses an isolated network with a dedicated attacker and honeypot to ensure all testing is safe and contained.  
- **Modular & Professional:** Built with high-quality components and a professional aesthetic, suitable for a capstone project.  
- **Comprehensive Logging & Reporting:** Collects and analyzes logs from all devices, with a dashboard for visualization and final reporting.

## System Architecture
- **Defender:** Raspberry Pi 5 (Polaris), running the AI defense stack.  
- **Attacker:** Raspberry Pi Zero WH (Halley), running Pwnagotchi.  
- **Honeypot:** Raspberry Pi 3B (Singularity), acting as a decoy for attackers.  
- **Control Station:** VM (Exoplanet), providing remote management.  

**Data Flow:**  
Halley (attacker) â†’ generates malicious traffic  
Singularity (honeypot) â†’ captures logs and events  
Polaris (defender) â†’ ingests/analyzes logs with AI â†’ produces alerts & final report
