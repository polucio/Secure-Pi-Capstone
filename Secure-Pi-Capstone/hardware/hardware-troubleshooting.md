# Pironman 5 Fan Troubleshooting – Final Report
**Date:** Sep 28, 2025  
**Device:** Polaris (Raspberry Pi 5)  
**Project:** Secure-Pi Capstone  

---

## 🛠 Problem Summary
Initially, none of the fans in the Pironman 5 case were running.  
- The two **RGB case fans** were not spinning.  
- The **CPU tower cooler (PWM fan)** would spin briefly at startup, then stop.

---

## ✅ Resolution Steps

### Case Fans (RGB, GPIO-Controlled)
- Installed Pironman 5 control software from GitHub.  
- Verified control with `pironman-cli`.  
- Forced fans into “Always On” mode for testing.  
- **Result:** Both case fans are now operational.

### Tower Cooler Fan (PWM-Controlled)
- Confirmed fan spins at boot (hardware functional).  
- Found it is temperature-controlled by the OS firmware.  
- Measured CPU temp at ~40 °C → below default 50 °C threshold.  
- Adjusted config to lower fan trigger point.  
- **Result:** Fan activates correctly under load.

## 🧹 System Cleanup
- Removed unused kernel versions from `/lib/modules/`.  
- Verified active kernel (`uname -r`) is **6.6.44-v8-16k+**.  
- System now runs with a single stable kernel set.

---

## 📊 Current Status
- **All 3 fans operational.**  
- **RGB lighting responsive.**  
- **Kernel space cleaned up.**  
- Hardware phase of capstone project complete.

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Begin **Phase 2: Security Hardening** (baseline OS security before building CySA+/PenTest+ labs).  
- Document new configs and scripts for reproducibility.
